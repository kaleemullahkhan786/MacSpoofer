## üåê Overview

**MacSpoofer** is a powerful and intuitive Python script tailored for cybersecurity enthusiasts and professionals. It provides seamless automation to spoof the MAC address of a network interface and effortlessly manage WiFi connections. Whether you are testing network security or simply exploring, this tool simplifies the process with just a few commands.

## ‚ú® Features

- **MAC Address Spoofing**: Instantly change your network interface's MAC address to any desired address.
- **WiFi Network Management**: Automatically add and connect to WiFi networks. If a network already exists, it intelligently skips re-adding and directly connects.
- **Root Privileges Verification**: Ensures the script is executed with the necessary root privileges for all operations.
- **Cross-Interface Compatibility**: Supports a wide range of network interfaces on Linux systems.
- **Comprehensive Logging**: All actions are logged into `mac_spoof.log` for easy troubleshooting and audit purposes.

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- **Linux Operating System**
- **Python 3.x**
- `nmcli` (NetworkManager Command Line Interface)
- `macchanger`
- `colorama`

## üì¶ Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kaleemullahkhan786/MacSpoofer.git
   cd MacSpoofer.py
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Install the required dependencies using `pip`:

   ```

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Run the Script**  
   Execute the script with root privileges:
   ```bash
   sudo python3 MacSpoofer.py
   ```

2. **Follow Prompts**  
   - **Network Interface**: Enter the name of your network interface (e.g., `wlan0`).
   - **Target MAC Address**: Enter the MAC address you wish to spoof (e.g., `00:11:22:33:44:55`).
   - **WiFi SSID**: Enter the SSID of the WiFi network.
   - **WiFi Password**: Enter the password for the WiFi network.

### üìñ Example

```bash
$ sudo python3 MacSpoofer.py
